# Reel Quest
This is a small (for now) side project I'm working on. It's a mock of IMDB. The movie data will be fetched from free movie-related APIs.
For information on features, refer to the Reel Quest Project Information markdown file in this repo.
Two other pieces of documentation are also included:
1. A client interface documentation which outlines the design of user side and the UI of the website.
2. A technical documentation which outlines the tools that will be used for creating the project and also the database models.

I might later decide to add a journal where I write the challenges that I faced and the solutions I came up with for them.
